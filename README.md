**Message**

I have completed the frontend portion of the coding exam as per the job description. Due to time constraints, I focused on the frontend.

I am confident in my work and would be happy to expand on it with backend implementation if time allows.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

## Goal UI: Installation and Development Setup

This README provides instructions on how to set up the Goal UI project and start development using Vite.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 14.18.0 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager) that typically comes bundled with Node.js

### Installation

1. **Clone the Existing Project:**

   If you don't have the project cloned locally yet, use the following command in your terminal to clone it from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:joshuadiezmo/goal-ui.git
   ```

   This will create a local copy of your project on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd goal-ui
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Most Vite projects use npm or yarn to manage dependencies. Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary packages listed in your project's `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Vite development server using:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will launch the development server, allowing you to work on your project and see changes reflected in the browser.

5. **Readme.md Updates:**

   The provided README.MD instructions assume a new project setup. You can keep the general guidelines about development server usage and refer to the official Vite documentation for more advanced configurations.
